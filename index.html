      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p> <img class="me-img" src="images/me.jpg" alt="Andreea Gugiuman" hspace="10" width="350">First of all, you should know that I'm a hichschool student in their 3rd year. I'm super passionate about</p>
      <p>music and piano as well as mathematics and sciences. I started piano at the age of 10 and am now</p>
      <p> in level 10 RCM. I continue to practice everyday so that later I will hopefully be able to start my own piano </p>
      <p>school or teach piano lessons to children. Math and science has also always been an something that</p>
      <p>i've been interested in just like both of my parents. Doing well in school is also very important to me and I </p>
      <p>usually aim to reach my full potential.</p>

      <p>Another interesting fact about me is that I was actually born in a far away country in eastern Europe</p>
      <p>... Romania! Romanian culture and the language is still very present in my life and I hope to be able</p>
      <p>to go back again and travel a lot more. I also go to full French school and have spoken the language</p>
      <p>since I was 7 years old. So as you can tell, I am trilingual and am still in the process of learning my</p>
      <p>fourth language, spanish. Oh yeah... I also have a really cute dog named Simba :)</p>
